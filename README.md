# My personal Myanimelist API simplifier

This project was built to help me simplify and understand more about the **Myanimelist API**, APIs in general and how to implement them in my projects. I don't plan to update this project as the API updates, so I don't recommend its use.

**This application was inspired by Chris-Kode wrapper for Myanimelist's API v2** , which is in constant updates. You should check it out: [Chris Kode's project](https://github.com/Chris-Kode/myanimelist-api-v2#built-with).
